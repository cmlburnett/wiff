WIFF -- Waveform Interchange File Format

This is a custom application file format that utilizes sqlite as the data storage mechanism of waveform information.
A waveform consists of a number of channels  and of arbitrary bit depth for each channel.
This binary data is accompanied by annotations to mark up the waveform data with specific information.
For example, a 12 lead EKG is a common waveform of 12 channels with markers that could includ P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves.

At this time, this library is very alpha and guarantee it has bugs and glitches.
The unit tests in both this library provide me with some confidence that it probably works as intended.

v1.0 was a custom binary format that I abandoned because of the difficulty maintaining a custom binary format when adding features.

### Test ###
Uses the unittest library:

	python setup.py test

### Install ###
This library relies on the sqlitehelper library I wrote.
No other external dependencies are needed.

Locally

	python setup.py install

Or globally

	sudo python3 setup.py install
