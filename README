WIFF -- Waveform Interchange File Format

This is a custom binary file format intended to be used for waveform data.
A waveform consists of a number of channels (up to 256 currently) and of arbitrary bit depth for each channel.
This binary data is accompanied by annotations to mark up the waveform data with specific information.
For example, a 12 lead EKG is a common waveform of 12 channels with markers that could includ P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves.

At this time, this library is very alpha and guarantee it has bugs and glitches.
The unit tests in both this library and bstruct provide me with some confidence that it probably works as intended.

### Test ###
Uses the unittest library:

	python setup.py test

### Install ###
This library relies on the bstruct library I wrote that mmap's binary data into Python memory space.
(The builtin library struct is utlized heavily to serialize and deserialize this binary data.)
No other dependencies are needed.

Locally

	python setup.py install

Or globally

	sudo python3 setup.py install
